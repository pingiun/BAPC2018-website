#### The contest

##### Introduction

* The language of the contest is English. All written contest materials will be in English.
* The contest lasts for 5 hours.
* From the beginning until one hour before the end of the BAPC, the scores are displayed.
* During the contest, all contestants will have to wear recognisable clothing provided by the organisation, unless explicit exemption is given by the organisation.

##### Problems

* At least six problems will be posed. So far as possible, problems will avoid dependence on detailed knowledge of a particular applications area or particular contest language.
* A contestant may submit a claim of ambiguity or error in a problem statement by submitting a clarification request to a judge. If the judges agree that an ambiguity or error exists, a clarification will be issued to all contestants.
* The jury has the right to change or withdraw problems during the contest. When this happens the jury will inform all teams.

##### System

* Each team will use a single workstation, consisting of a table for the team members and one computer. The organisation is responsible for determining that teams have reasonably equivalent computing resources.
* A solution for a problem has to be written in C99, C++ (version 14 or later will be available), Python (versions 2 and 3 will be available using pypy), Java (version 11 or later) or Kotlin (version 1.3), unless the problem statement explicitly states otherwise. Business teams can request other submission languages, on which the organisation will decide whether it will be made available for submission.
* For every solution, only the standard library of the chosen language may be used, i.e. no other function calls can be made.
* All prints made by the teams will be brought by a runner. Participants are not allowed near the printers.
* A team is allowed to bring up to 25 A4-sized pages, printed one-sided or up to 12.5 A4-sized pages, printed two-sided, of documentation. Text and illustrations must be readable by a person with correctable eyesight without magnification from a distance of 1/2 meter. Each team member is allowed one identical copy.

##### Judgement

* Each run is judged as accepted or rejected by a judge, and the team is notified of the results.
* For each problem, the jury has a correct solution and test data.
* A problem is solved when it is accepted by the judges. The judges are solely responsible for accepting or rejecting runs.
* The winner of the pool is decided by (in order):
    1. The team with most correctly solved problems.
    2. The team with the least total time. The total time is the sum of the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to the submittal of the accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every rejected run for that problem regardless of submittal time. There is no time consumed for a problem that is not solved.
    3. The team that first submitted its last accepted problem is ranked higher. In case a tie still remains, the team that first submitted its second-last accepted problem is ranked higher, and so on. In the event that this does not resolve the tie, the ranks will be determined by chance.
* The jury is responsible for everything that has to do with the problem set and can be contacted for this through the "clarification requests".

#### Special rules

* A team may be disqualified by the organisation or jury for any activity that jeopardises the contest such as dislodging extension cords, unauthorised modification, unintended use of contest materials, using forbidden function or library calls or distracting behaviour.
* The organisation has the right to stop the contest, extending the contest time, temporarily block submissions for all teams or change the scores in exceptional conditions.
* In situations to which no rule applies or there is ambiguity about the rules, the organisation decides.
* If necessary, the organisation can make changes and exception to the rules.
